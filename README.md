# App-Health-Scanner
App Health &amp; Crash Diagnostic – A PowerShell/WPF tool for Windows 10/11 that scans system and application crash events, hangs, reliability data, and system info. Includes filters, process picker, summaries, suggestions, and exportable diagnostic bundles.

PS1 and EXE are the same app, just different execution. Use as see fit. 

> With PS1 file, drop the file in a location, open terminal/powershell, navigate to the directory, use **Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass** to remove script prompt, and then type in the .\AppHealthScanner_v2.ps1 and enter. Execution policy will reset with close/reopen of terminal window.
